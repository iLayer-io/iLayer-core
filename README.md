> iLayer is a cross-chain intent-based solver hub primitive.

This repository contains the core smart contracts for iLayer V1.

## Key Features

- Swap tokens from one chain to the other in a cheap and fast way.
- Bridge tokens without needing to have gas on the destination chain.
- Access DeFi protocols without using their complex UX with one click.
- Build cross-chain protocols leveraging the iLayer infrastructure.

## Security

> Audit reports are available in the _audits_ folder.

The codebase comes with full test coverage, including unit, integration and fuzzy tests.

Smart contracts have been tested with the following automated tools:

- [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither)
- [mythril](https://github.com/Consensys/mythril)
- [halmos](https://github.com/a16z/halmos)
- [olympix](https://www.olympix.ai)
